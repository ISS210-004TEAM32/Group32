                        <p>Children have always been the highest risk group when it comes to cyber security.  This is due to lack of experience and not knowing what to look for when it comes to shady things on the internet.  With the switch to online education becoming so prevalent in today's time, children are becoming even higher at risk than they were before.</p>
                        <p>It was stated in the article that cybercrimes aginst children skyrocketed 144 percent in the year 2020 alone and is still on the increase to this day.  This data shows how important it is that we educate our children on cyber safety.</p>
                     
 
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Numbers</h2>
                        <p>Some important statistics found in the article:  </p>
                        <p>Six out of ten Children ages 8-12 are exposed to cyber risks.  50 percent of children experience cyberbullying.  One third of children fall for phishing or hacking.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Annual financial losses from cybercrimes against children reached US$660,000 (YoY decrease by 32 percent) in 2020 alone.</blockquote>
                        <p>These statistics show the importance of teaching cyber security to our children.  Children everywhere are getting scammed, groomed, and are just generally unsafe on the internet.  In the current world with online schooling and the demand for social media, there is a huge amount of children on the internet.  They need to be taught.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Informing Our Children</h2>
                        <p>There are certain techniques parents can use to make children grasp the information better.  Children don't respond well to confrontational like conversations, so instead of trying to scare them away, be gentle with them while explaining the dangers of the internet.  Another good tactic is to make sure to build trust with them while explaining so they are as comfortable as possible.  It is very important that we teach children the basics of internet safety, such as how to change passwords and keep personal information safe.  It may even be a good idea to implement some rules and boundaries, or maybe use some parental controls on their favorite apps.</p>
                        <p>Children also respond better to things they think are fun and entertaining, the link below is an interactive cartoon by Surfshark, it is perfect for teaching children the importance of safety on the internet, along with how to handle cyberbullying, and be safe while gaming</p>

                        <p>A short converstaion with your kids could keep them from doing something unsafe on the internet.  Whether its being hacked, lured into giving out personal information, being groomed by a creepy adult, it can be prevented.  The numbers show how important this conversation is in today's time.  Don't wait until its too late.</p>

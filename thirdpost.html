                        <p>Online grooming is when someone uses the internet as a way to get close and sexually exploit children. In our current world, agencies saw a dramatic rise in online luring cases likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                        <p>Anyone can be a victim of grooming but typically it has been found that online predators will target children they believe to be more vulnerable. This can include children with disabilities, children in care systems, and even children suffering through neglect or abuse from their home. Online groomers tend to build trust with their victims and will use this relationship to continually exploit them for long periods of time.</p>
                        <p>The reason they last so long is because of the manipulation of children into being quiet. A child may feel embarrassed or guilty and not want to share, or they may fear their parent’s reaction if they found out.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Is my child being groomed?</h2>
                        <p>Here we will look at and discuss some of the warning signs in children who may be being groomed online…</p>
                        <p>1. They withdraw from friends and family.</p>
                        <p>Children who are victims of grooming often feel disconnected from people in their real life and fall prey to online predators. If you notice your child feeling distant and drawing away from you, have a conversation with them and create a safe and welcoming environment for them.</p>
                        <p>2. They are secretive about how they spend their time online.</p>
                        <p>Especially in cases where the child has a fear or embarrassment about the situation they may try and conceal what is going on. Professionals recommend that parents of younger children have “house rules” when it comes to electronics. These can include rules such as: devices may only be used in open spaces.</p>
                        <p>3. Unexplained gifts or money.</p>
                        <p>One of the many manipulation tactics of groomers includes using their own money in order to gain the child’s favor and trust through buying them toys or games. This is especially common in grooming cases in which the predator also knows the child in real life.</p>
                        <p>4. Increases in their daily screen time.</p>
                        <p>Online predators will often use trickery or even threats to keep children engaged with them, they also manipulate the child into feeling safe and wanting to spend time with them. Setting limits on your child’s screen time will help with their overall internet use, with the added benefit it will encourage them to engage with face-to-face trusted friends.</p>
                        <p>5. Certain mood or behavior changes.</p>
                        <p>There are many psychological effects that impact victims of grooming. A child may be unable to sleep, they may become withdrawn or anxious, and they may be quicker to get angry at other people. If your child is struggling, encourage them to reach out.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Looking out for groomers online…</h2>
                        <p>Mentioned in the video below are several things to look out for when talking to someone new on the internet. Many children communicate and meet others through group forums or social media sites. An online predator can be any age and may even pretend to be someone else entirely. When communicating online it is important to know who it is you are really talking to and protect yourself by not sharing any of your personal information, as well as not giving into the pressure of those you talk to.</p>

                        <p>If you or someone you know is a victim of online grooming, you can make a call or report to your local child service agency. The only way we can combat this issue is to educate ourselves and keep an eye out for warning signs.</p>
